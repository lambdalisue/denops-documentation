## install `mdBook`

You can install `mdBook` from
[their release page of the github
repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases). If you'd like to
install on the other way, see
[documentation of `mdBook`](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook#installation).

## Write documentation

The documentation is written entirely in markdown. Find the document when
changing something, or create new markdown file and add it to
[`SUMMARY`](https://github.com/vim-denops/denops-documentation/blob/main/src/SUMMARY.md)
for adding a new page. You can watch the preview in `localhost:3000` with
running `mdbook serve`; explained in detail
[here](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook#usage).
