# Tutorial (Maze)

Now that you have grasped the basics of developing Denops plugins in the
previous chapters, it's time to delve into creating a more functional plugin.

So, out of the blue, have you ever felt the urge to solve mazes while
programming? Personally, I haven't, but there might be enthusiasts who enjoy it
immensely. In any case, let's embark on developing a Denops plugin that can
generate and display a maze in Vim at any time. Well, don't ask me why we would
want to do that.
