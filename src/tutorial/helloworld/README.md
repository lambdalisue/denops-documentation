# Tutorial: Hello World

In this chapter, we will create a minimal Denops plugin that greets the user.
Most of the code resembles the previous
[Getting Started](../../getting-started/index.html), so feel free to skip this
chapter if you are already familiar with it.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The plugin we will create in this section can be found at
